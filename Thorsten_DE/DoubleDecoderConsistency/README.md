This is a :frog: Coqui TTS recipe to train Double Decoder Consistency (DDC) model on
Thorsten's German dataset.

You can learn more about DDC [here](https://erogol.com/solving-attention-problems-of-tts-models-with-double-decoder-consistency/) and
the German dataset [here](https://github.com/thorstenMueller/deep-learning-german-tts/).

This recipe trains a DDC model and a MultiBand-MelGAN vocoder.

TODO:
- Add a notebook for inference
